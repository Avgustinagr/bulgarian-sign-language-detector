# bulgarian-sign-language-detector
A model that can (almost) detect Bulgarian sign language alphabet (in real time)

<sup>pip freeze in ./requirements.txt (scikit-learn==1.3.2)</sup>
<h3>Heads-up: </h3>
<uol>
  <li><code><b>Bulgarian_sign_language_detector.ipynb</b></code>  - Main deliverable:  </li>
  <li><code>DataCollection.ipynb</code> and <code>DataProcessing.ipynb</code> use files that are not in this repo/zip. If needed, access to them is provided via link in the notebooks themselves.</li>
  <li><code>live_classification.py</code> - very ugly; extra file in which I wanted to try the model out irl. It is still very unomptimized and buggy when it comes to UX.</li>
  <li>Drafts - not my best work</li>
