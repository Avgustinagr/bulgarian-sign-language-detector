# bulgarian-sign-language-detector
A model that can detect Bulgarian sign language alphabet (in real time)

Heads-up: 
- pip freeze in ./requirements.txt (scikit-learn==1.3.2)
- Main deliverable: Bulgarian_sign_language_detector.ipynb
  
- DataCollection.ipynb and DataProcessing.ipynb use files that are not in this repo/zip. If needed, access to them is provided via link in the notebooks themselves.
- live_classification.py - very ugly; extra file in which I wanted to try the model out irl. It is still very unomptimized and buggy when it comes to UX.
- Drafts - not my best work
